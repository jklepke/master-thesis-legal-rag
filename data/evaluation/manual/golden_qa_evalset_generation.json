A smart meter consists of a digital electricity meter and a communication unit, the so-called smart meter gateway. In contrast to the conventional analog “Ferraris meter”, a digital electricity meter not only shows the current meter reading, but also the actual electricity consumption and the actual time of use (e.g. day, week, month, year). The smart meter gateway (SMGW) is a particularly secure interface. It connects consumers and producers of electricity with the operators of the electricity grids and supply companies. The smart meter gateway enables meters to be integrated into the smart grid in compliance with data protection and data security regulations. "

In addition, operators of wind turbines that were commissioned before the end of December 31, 2024 must also make a payment to the grid operator if they have not immediately submitted a complete and verifiable application for approval of demand-controlled night-time identification to the competent state authority. The payment to be made amounts to EUR 10 per kilowatt of installed capacity of the system and calendar month in which this breach of duty occurs or continues continuously or temporarily.

        "ground_truth":"The Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) 2023 places a clear focus on the accelerated expansion of photovoltaics in order to cover at least 80% of the electricity generated in Germany from renewable energies by 2030. To this end, 22 gigawatts of PV capacity are to be added each year, with the aim of achieving a total of 215 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2030. The key changes include a new remuneration structure: in future, a distinction will be made between full feed-in and surplus feed-in, with different remuneration rates applying. The values to be applied for solar installations on, on or in buildings and on noise barriers will be redefined. At the same time, the previous 70% reduction for systems up to 25 kWp has been completely abolished. The previous regulation that only 80% of the electricity generated by systems between 300 kW and 750 kW is eligible for subsidies will expire on January 1, 2023. The monthly degression of the feed-in tariff (so-called “breathing cap”) will also be discontinued. Instead, the feed-in tariffs will only be reduced by 1% every six months from February 2024. A further advance is the flexibilization of system use: in future, full feed-in and partial feed-in systems may be installed simultaneously on the same roof area - the previous waiting period of two years no longer applies. Special PV system types such as agri-PV, floating PV and parking lot PV will be integrated into the tenders for ground-mounted systems. Particularly cost-intensive agri-PV projects can receive additional bonuses. A new addition is the segment of so-called moorland PV, i.e. PV systems on rewetted moorland.  The grid connection processes are also being reformed: Grid operators are obliged to provide a digital and uniform nationwide portal for grid inquiries and to adhere to deadlines for processing them. Finally, tenant electricity has also been promoted - the previous 100 kW limit has been removed so that larger systems can also receive tenant electricity surcharges in future."

        "ground_truth":"In addition to extended expansion targets for solar energy, the EEG 2023 will also adjust the expansion targets and tender volumes for wind power. A total of around 115 GW of wind capacity is to be installed in Germany by 2030. The expansion rates for onshore wind energy are to be increased to a level of 10 GW per year.\nIn addition to these targets, the so-called southern quota, i.e. the special treatment for tenders in the southern region of Germany, has been abolished. Instead, the necessary expansion of wind power in the south of Germany is to be achieved by improving the correction factors for poor wind locations. It is also assumed that the increase in the volume of tenders will lead to an increase in the expansion of wind power plants in the southern region of Germany.\nIn order to achieve the EEG expansion targets, detailed changes and progress are set out in the “Wind Energy at Sea Act (WindSeeG)”. The most important points include the following:\nThe expansion of offshore wind energy is to be based on two equal pillars in future. In addition to the tendering of areas that have already been pre-investigated, areas that have not yet been pre-investigated will also be put out to tender in future.\nIn particular, the expansion targets for offshore installations will be increased: At least 30 GW by 2030, at least 40 GW by 2035 and at least 70 GW by 2045.\nThe amendment to the “Wind Energy at Sea Act (WindSeeG)” is intended to speed up all procedures: Grid connection will be awarded earlier, planning and approval procedures will be streamlined and reviews will be bundled.\nDetailed targets and changes for onshore wind power are set out in the newly adopted “Wind-on-Land Act”."

To this end, biomethane may only be used in highly flexible power plants that generate electricity for a maximum of 10% of the hours in a year. In addition, the previous size limit of 10 MW for biomethane plants will no longer apply.\nThe EEG 2023 also stipulates that only new plants will be able to participate in biomethane tenders in future. Plants that are already operated with other renewable energies or fossil fuels are therefore excluded. Furthermore, it is stipulated that biomethane plants with an installed capacity of more than 10 MW must be able to be converted from January 1, 2028 so that the electricity in the plants can be generated exclusively on the basis of hydrogen."
